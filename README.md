# Pawfect Match

Find the canine companion that'll match your lifestyle! - Find out which dog breed matches your lifestyle!

### Description

Our app aims to provide users with personalised dog breed recommendations based on their preferences and lifestyle. We strive to create an engaging and user-friendly experience that helps individuals find the perfect furry companion for their home and lifestyle.

It'll do this by taking the users information such as house size, training requirements/experience etc in a questionnaire. The user's responses are matched and then sent as params to [API-Ninja&#39;s dog API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/dogs). The results will be shown to user and hopefully they will find their pawfect match! . User can signup to save questionnaire responses, which means they can come back at a later date to see results, and can also change response to the questionnaire.
